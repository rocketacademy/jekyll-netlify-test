# ❤️ Social Rules

Programming, more so than other technical domains is a culture. Each language, framework and coding style has it's own traditions and style of conducting itself. The culture of Lisp programmers is quite different from the culture of Java programmers. Rails programmers have a different culture than Wordpress programmers. In this sense, this page describes some of the human elements of this course and of Rocket Academy that we want to emphasize.

### Community Building

In Rocket Academy, even though we don't meet physically in person, a significant portion of the experience is about interacting with your peers. With this course we are trying to build a community of like-minded learners.

You will be asked to complete exercises collaboratively with another person who might know more than you or who might know less than you about the task at hand. This is by design, since we think that a great learning environment is one in which the clear communication of your own understanding of a concept is a great way to cement your knowledge. This doesn't just refer to teaching someone who knows less, but also to summarize and clarify your thinking to someone who understands more.

We hope to create a culture of intellectual honesty and curiosity where people are not afraid to ask "stupid" questions and posit theories based on their own current level of understanding without feeling afraid. We feel that most people understand how vulnerable and scary this can feel, and therefore want to make people in RA as comfortable as possible to express themselves and what their thought process is. 

Our goal for every student is empathetic communication that makes everyone feel safe to ask anything they need to in order to maximize their learning.

### Social Rules

In a technical environment it can be easy to feel that you "don't know anything", or that you "don't know what you're doing". Sometimes this can be influenced by a technical culture in which being "correct" is more important than communicating with empathy.

These social rules are guidelines to encourage learning rather than "correctness" for correctness sake. In the following rules we outline some common technical discussion styles that we feel can inhibit a free and open communication culture by making people feel less comfortable to raise questions and participate in discussions, while not positively adding to the technical aspects of that discussion.

They are unabashedly taken from [Recurse Center.](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)

The social rules are:

* No well-actually’s
* No feigned surprise
* No backseat driving
* No subtle -isms

**One thing that often confuses people about the social rules is that we expect people to break them from time to time. This means they’re different and totally separate from our code of conduct.**

## No well-actually’s

> **Alice:** I just installed Linux on my computer!
>
> **Bob:** It’s actually called GNU/Linux.

A well-actually is when you correct someone about something that’s not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what they’re trying to say. They’re bad because they aren’t helpful, break the flow of conversation, and focus attention on the person making the well actually.

This rule can be a bit tricky because there isn’t a clear line between relevant to the conversation and not. Sometimes your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it. The best rule of thumb is, if you’re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens. You can always say it later if it turns out there’s no way for the conversation to move forward without your correction.

## No feigning surprise

> **Dan:** What’s the command line?
>
> **Carol:** _Wait,_ you’ve never used the command line??

Feigned surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the future, which makes it harder for them to learn.

No feigning surprise isn’t a great name. When someone acts surprised when you don’t know something, it doesn’t matter whether they’re pretending to be surprised or actually surprised. The effect is the same: the next time you have a question, you’re more likely to keep your mouth shut. An accurate name for this rule would be no acting surprised when someone doesn’t know something, but it’s a mouthful, and at this point, the current name has stuck.

## No backseat driving

> **Bob:** What’s the name of the string copy function?
>
> **Alice:** Strncpy.
>
> **Eve:** \(from across the room\) You should use strlcpy. It’s safer.

Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room \(or across the online chat\) without really joining or engaging in a conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice that’s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it’s rude to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.

## No subtle -isms

Carol: Windows is hard to use.

Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.

Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. Subtle -isms make people feel like they don’t belong at Rocket Academy. We want to create an environment where everyone can focus all their energy on programming. It’s hard to do that if you’re regularly being made to wonder whether you belong.

Subtle -isms can also be things that you do instead of say. This includes things like boxing out the only woman at the whiteboard during a discussion or assuming someone isn’t a programmer because of their race or gender.

The fourth social rule is more complicated than the others. Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize. And not everyone experiences subtle -isms in the same way: subtle homophobia won’t hurt someone who’s straight in the same way it hurts someone who’s gay.

There’s another part of no subtle -isms: If you see racism, sexism, etc. outside of Rocket Academy, please don’t bring it in. For example, please don’t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Tech Person Y. Everyone who comes to Rocket Academy should have the same opportunity to focus on programming, and people from oppressed groups often find discussions of racism, sexism, etc. particularly hard to tune out. There are many places to discuss and debate these issues, but there are few where people can avoid them. Rocket Academy is one of those places.

## How do they work?

The social rules are lightweight.

_**You should not be afraid of breaking a social rule.**_

These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, "hey, you just feigned surprise," or "that’s subtly sexist," don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on.

The social rules aren’t for punishing people. They help make Rocket Academy a pleasant environment where you are free to be yourself, tackle things outside your comfort zone, and focus on programming.

## Code of conduct

The social rules don’t cover harassment or discrimination. For that, we have a separate code of conduct enforced by the faculty. All members of the community are expected to abide by our code of conduct.

RA's Code of Conduct states:

1. Be respectful of others.
2. Only submit your own work.
