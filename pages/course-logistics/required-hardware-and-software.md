description: 'To partake in RA''s courses, we will need the following hardware and software.'
---

# ðŸ’» Required Hardware and Software

## Required Hardware

1. Desktop or laptop computer running the latest version of Windows or MacOS.
2. Webcam and microphone capable of enabling video conferencing on your computer. These are built-in for most laptops.
3. Internet connection that is able to run Zoom calls with no interruptions in audio or video. If you're not sure, let us know and we can schedule a chat!

## Required GUI-Application Software

GUI-application software is software we run with a graphical user interface \(GUI\) on our operating system.

### Slack

Slack is RA's primary mode of communication. It allows us to communicate across our school, within sections, and between individuals. Many tech companies internationally use Slack for internal communication.

#### **Installation**

1. Download the Slack mobile app from the Android Play Store or iOS App Store
2. Download the Slack desktop app for your relevant operating system [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/help/categories/360000049043-Getting-started).

### Zoom

Zoom is RA's video conferencing software for class. Each section will have its own Zoom link to join for each class.

#### **Installation**

1. Download the Zoom Client for Meetings [here](https://zoom.us/download).
2. Start a new meeting to test that your webcam and microphone are working.

### Chrome

Chrome is the most popular web browser for software engineers because of its mature developer tools, which we will soon see in course videos. Chrome also has the largest library of browser extensions, which further help developers build and maintain software.

#### **Installation**

1. Download Chrome for your OS [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_sg/chrome/).

### VSCode

VSCode is the most popular code editor in the world. We will write all code for Coding Basics inside of VSCode. Download VSCode for your OS [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Window-Snapping Software

On both Windows and Mac there are features to snap windows to standard sizes and places on our screen using keyboard shortcuts. This is especially helpful when coding and we want to view code on one side and documentation on another. The alternative is to manually drag windows and resize them.

**Windows Installation**

Window snapping is built-in to Windows, and you can take advantage of it with instructions [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4027324/windows-10-snap-your-windows).

**Mac Installation**

Window snapping is not built-in to MacOS, and we will need to download an external program to snap windows. We recommend any of the following.

1. [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) \(free\) is an actively-maintained open-source window snapping app. We recommend this to start.
2. [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) \(S$10.98\) is an actively-maintained window snapping app on the Mac App Store. It mostly has the same features as Rectangle, and might be more user-friendly because it's managed through the App Store. From what we can tell, it serves the same function as Rectangle.

## Required Command-Line Software

Command-line software is software primarily operated from the command line \(we will explain this in a video\) that may not have a graphical user interface we can interact with. This software is typically used by software developers to write programs. Command-line software is in a separate section so that students do not expect to run this software from their computer's Applications folder.

### Git

Git is the most popular software version control system. All tech companies use version control to manage contributions to and releases of their software. We will be using basic Git during Coding Basics to download and upload copies of projects.

On Windows, Git installation also enables us to run our terminal in the Bash programming language. The terminal is the program that allows us to run commands on our computers. Bash is a terminal language used across OSes, allowing us to run commands on our computers in the same way across Windows and Mac. A version of Bash called Zsh \(pronounced "zoosh"\) is installed by default on MacOS.

**Installation**

1. Download and install Git for your OS \(Windows or MacOS\) [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). **When copying commands from the Git website, do not copy the dollar sign \($\) in front of the command.** The dollar signs in their commands denote the start of command lines, and are not part of the commands.
   1. Mac: We should be able to install Git by typing the following command in our terminal, hitting `enter`, and following the prompts. Follow instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) to open our VSCode terminal.

      ```text
      git --version
      ```

   2. Windows: This is the Windows install link. Make sure you install the .exe file that automatically downloads instead of any other. [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
      1. If we need to re-download the .exe for any reason, click the "Click here to download manually" button on that page instead of any other.
      2. In the Git installer program, click Next until the end, no need to customise defaults.
2. \[Windows Only\] Follow [command line setup instructions below](required-hardware-and-software.md#windows-command-line-setup) to set Bash as the terminal language.
3. Verify Git is installed by running `git --version` in the [VSCode terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal). This should print out a version number on the next line like `git version 2.28.0`.

 
Git needs to be installed on the same drive as VSCode. If you happen to have 2 drives on your computer, e.g. C and D drives, make sure both VSCode and Git are installed on the same drive.
 

### Windows Command Line Setup

We will need to use the command line \(also known as a terminal, more on this in a later module\) during Coding Basics. Windows uses a terminal language called PowerShell by default, but this is not the most widely-used terminal language. Most software engineers use terminal languages made for Unix-based operating systems, e.g. Linux and MacOS. To ensure that Windows and Mac users can use the same terminal commands, Windows users will need to install Bash, a Unix-based terminal language. Please [download and install Git](required-hardware-and-software.md#git) first. The following instructions are adapted from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994).

![VSCode Terminal on Windows. PowerShell is the Default Terminal Language on Windows.](../.gitbook/assets/v4hx4.png)

1. Open Visual Studio Code and open the terminal \(accessed from the top-level menu\). We should see something like the screenshot above, with the word "powershell" in the dropdown menu. If you're not able to open the terminal with the keyboard shortcut, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) for other ways to open the terminal.
2. Open the command palette using `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
3. Type and select "Terminal: Select Default Profile".
4. Select "Git Bash" from the dropdown.
5. Restart VSCode, close the terminal, and open a new terminal. The terminal should now run with Bash.

![VSCode Terminal on Windows Running the Bash Terminal Language](../.gitbook/assets/5zlap.png)

We shouldn't need to, but if we need to, we can toggle between different terminal languages from the dropdown in our VSCode terminal.

![Toggle between Bash, PowerShell, and Any Other Terminal Languages in VSCode Terminal](../.gitbook/assets/1agtr.png)

## VSCode Formatters

### Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter that will auto-format our code and make it more readable when we save our files.

1. Install the Prettier extension for VSCode [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). 
2. Restart VSCode to activate Prettier.

### VSCode Formatting Settings

1. Open VSCode and open the command prompt with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac.
2. Start typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and select this option when you see it in the search dropdown. A JSON settings file should open in VSCode.
3. Replace everything on the screen \(in the file\) with the code below.
4. Save the settings file.
5. Restart VSCode to apply our settings.
6. Open and save the settings file again and verify that Prettier auto-formats it as our default formatter.

 
Windows users: The following code assumes we installed our Git folder at the root of our C drive. Some students' installers install the Git folder elsewhere, for example in `C:\\Program Files (x86)`. If your installed Git folder is not in the root of your C drive, please update the paths to the Git folder below to reference the location of your Git folder. 
 

```text
{
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	"editor.formatOnPaste": true,
	"editor.minimap.enabled": true,
	"editor.tabSize": 2,
	"editor.wordWrap": "on",
	"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
	"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
	"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash",
	"terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
		"Git Bash": {
			"path": "C:\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
			"icon": "terminal-bash"
		}
	}
}
```

#### \[No Action Needed\]  Suggestion Highlighting

As we code, VSCode may suggest fixes to our code by highlighting errors. Some of these suggestions will be optional but others may cause our programs to break.

![](../.gitbook/assets/eslint-1.png)

To discern what problems VSCode is raising, we can view the suggestion messages in the console.

![](../.gitbook/assets/eslint-2.png)

To view messages in the console, use the following steps.

1. Click the error icon in the bottom left of the VSCode footer. This will show the suggestion pane below our code.
2. For each suggestion there will be a line in the suggestion pane with a sentence about what VSCode suggests, and the relevant line number in the code file.

## Required Software Accounts

### GitHub

GitHub is the most popular code-hosting platform. Developers around the world use GitHub to share code and collaborate on projects. Rocket Academy's starter code and project templates are hosted on GitHub, and we will use GitHub in Coding Basics to download, host, and submit assignments. Each student will need a GitHub account to host and submit assignment code.

#### **Sign Up**

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), click the Sign Up button and follow on-screen instructions.

#### **Git and GitHub Credential Configuration**

Add your GitHub account credentials to your computer through the command line. Please replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` AND `<YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL>` with your credentials. Note to replace the `<>` characters and keep the `"` characters in the commands.

```text
git config --global user.name "<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>"
```

```text
git config --global user.email "<YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL>"
```

You will not get any feedback from the terminal after entering these commands. Type the following command into the terminal to check your work. If you see a `:` at the bottom of the output, you may need to press `Enter` until you see the lines starting with `user.name` and `user.email`.

#### Git default branch configuration

Following the convention of all the other Rocket Academy Git repositories and GitHub, we'll change the default Git branch name.

```text
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

#### Configuration Check

```text
git config -l
```

You should see your username and email in the output, and possibly some other settings.

#### Personal Access Token

In addition to setting a password for your GitHub account, you will need to generate a Personal Access Token to use GitHub on the command line. Follow GitHub's instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for how to set up and use Personal Access Tokens.

## Folder Structure for Coding Basics

In Coding Basics we will be creating many folders and cloning the starter code multiple times. To keep our code organised, we recommend the following folder structure.

 
All code-related files and folders are in lowercase and kebab case \(hyphenated\) for ease of use on the command line. It is generally a bad idea to name any files or folders with a space in them, because spaces need to be escaped with backslash \(`\`\) on the command line.
 

1. Host all Coding Basics code in a folder called `basics`. Keep this in your `Documents` folder.
2. Within the `basics` folder, for each class session \(there are 12 total\) in Basics, create a new folder for that day. This means you will have 12 day-specific folders, such as `day1`, `day2`, ..., `day12`.
3. Within each `dayX` folder, create 1 folder for pre-class exercises and another folder for in-class exercises. These can look like `pre-class` and `in-class`, or any other naming scheme that works for you.
4. Within `pre-class` and `in-class` folders, keep a separate folder for every exercise you do that requires you to create a new Git repository or clone a new copy of the Basics starter code.

 
As a shortcut, we can run the following command in the terminal to create all the folders.

1. Open the `Documents` folder in VSCode with File &gt; Open Folder and choose `Documents`.
2. Run the following command.

   ```text
   mkdir -p basics/day{1..12}/{in-class,pre-class}
   ```
 

 
When cloning the starter code, choose to [name the target folder](../4-getting-started-with-code/4.1-intro-to-github.md#git-clone) to the relevant exercise name. This is so that we do not end up with Git repositories within Git repositories, which can confuse Git and cause issues.

### Open Basics Folder in VSCode

When working with code, it's often necessary to jump between different files in the same repository, or even across repositories. Instead of using File &gt; Open to open a specific _file_ each time, we can save time by opening the _folder_ that contains all the files we may want to access. We can do this on Windows by going to File &gt; Open Folder, or on Mac with File &gt; Open, and selecting the relevant folder. This will open the folder and its file structure in the VSCode sidebar, allowing us to quickly jump between files in that folder without having to File &gt; Open every time.

 
For Coding Basics, we recommend storing all of your code in a folder called `basics` as per the [recommended folder structure](required-hardware-and-software.md#folder-structure-for-coding-basics), and keeping that folder open in VSCode for the duration of the course.

## Slack House Rules

### Ask Questions in the Channel

During RA's courses you will have questions about the material. To ensure your questions get answered soonest, and so that others can help and learn, please ask questions in the batch-wide channel. Please refrain from DMing \(direct messaging\) instructors with questions about course material.

### Provide Context for Questions

To get help effectively, we need to provide context. One of the biggest differences between junior and senior engineers is the amount of relevant context they provide with their questions. Junior engineers tend to ask questions without context: "It doesn't work. Could you help?" Senior engineers tend to ask questions with relevant context: "Program A is giving me Error X. I didn't expect X to happen because of Logic B. When I googled X, it told me that this might be related to Y, but I don't see Y anywhere in the system." At Rocket Academy, we want to be like senior engineers.

Try to answer the following when asking questions.

1. What is the problem? Include any relevant error messages in text or screenshots.
2. What is your hypothesis? Include relevant code snippets, [formatted as code](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/help/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet) in Slack.
3. What have you tried? Include any relevant output or Google results.

### Format Code in Slack

When sharing code in Slack, it's best to use Slack's built-in code formatting, which creates code blocks with monospaced text for easier reading. For single-line code like variables or files/folders in regular text, we can use a single backtick \(\`\) at the start and end of the code to format it. For multi-line blocks of code like functions, we recommend using [Slack code snippets](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/help/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet) which include syntax highlighting and take up less space in the Slack window.
