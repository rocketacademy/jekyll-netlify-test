# 12.2: HTML, CSS Review

In order to write DOM JavaScript we need to know some basics about how HTML and CSS work.

The JavaScript code that grabs an element on the screen is the same as the code that applies a CSS style to an HTML element.

## Referencing HTML elements

We'll review two basic ways to reference an HTML element.

For a comprehensive list see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) or try [this exercise](https://flukeout.github.io/).

## Classes

More than one class can be applied to an element and more than one element can apply a class.

```markup
// This is the HTML File

<p class="card face-down">ace of spades</p>
<p class="card face-up">ace of clubs</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
// This is the CSS file

.card {
  background-color: pink;
}

.face-up {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.page-link {
  font: 'comic-sans';
}
```

## IDs

Only one ID can be applied to an element, though if you break this rule you won't get any errors, maybe just some unintended behaviours. An element can have both an ID and classes.

```markup
<p id="player-card-one" class="card face-up">ace of spades</p>
```

This CSS grabs these elements and applies these styles.

```css
#player-card-one {
  border: 3px solid red;
}

#save-button {
  color: green;
}
```
