## Why Browsers

Web browsers are tools to view web pages and not necessary for writing and executing code. In SWE101 we will use browsers as a learning tool to visualise inputs and outputs of our code through a web page.

## Web Browser History

The World Wide Web and web browsers were born in 1990 when Tim Berners-Lee invented a way to view HTML documents through the Internet.

## HTML

The fundamental thing a browser did in 1990 was download and view HTML web site pages. This is still core to the functionality of how a browser works, so we are going to start there.

## Exercises

### Run Starter Code in Browser

1. Download a compressed ZIP file from [this link](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code/archive/main.zip).
2. If you haven't already, create a `swe101` folder in a local folder, e.g. `Documents`.
3. Move the downloaded .zip file to the `swe101` folder.
4. Unzip the file - it should create a new `swe101-starter-code` folder. The starter code files are in this folder.
5. Open the `index.html` file in Chrome. Double click it if Chrome is your default browser. Or, you can right click to open in Chrome.

### Change HTML Text on Page

1. Change line `53` \(Basics!\) to something else. Make sure to save the file before you refresh.
2. Change the text of the button on line `57`.
