Coding means writing instructions for the computer to execute. We will begin with basic instructions the computer can execute, which are operations between 2 number data values.

## **Setup**

1. Open a new tab in the Chrome browser by clicking File &gt; New Tab, or pressing `Cmd+T` on Mac or `Ctrl+T` on Windows.
2. Open Chrome Developer Tools by clicking View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console, pressing `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows, or right clicking anywhere in Chrome and clicking Inspect.
3. Select the JavaScript Console tab in Chrome Dev Tools.

## Exercises

The JavaScript language is capable of performing math operations. Enter the following calculations into the Chrome Dev Tools Console, followed by the `Enter` key.

```javascript
2 + 2;
```

```javascript
4 * 2;
```

```javascript
4 / 2;
```
