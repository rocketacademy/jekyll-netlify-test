# 7.1: GitHub Fork and Pull Request

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/uMNcnLWTmZU" caption="" %}

We will learn more features of Git and GitHub to start and submit Coding Basics projects. As a reminder, Git is the version control system and GitHub is the code-hosting website built on top of Git. GitHub extends the capabilities of Git by adding visual code browsing, social features, and collaboration features like "forks" and "pull requests". Feel free to use this page as a resource if you need help starting or submitting a project.

### GitHub Fork

"Fork" is the GitHub term for copying a repo from one GitHub account to another. We can fork a repo by clicking the Fork button on a given GitHub repo page. Forking allows us to make changes to a repo and save those changes to our own GitHub account's copy of the repo. Our account's repo is essentially independent from the original, forked repo.

"Fork" is a GitHub concept. Forking is not built-in to the Git version control system.

### Git Push

We will learn 1 new Git command `push` to send local code commits from our computers to GitHub. `push` can also be used as a general command to move code between "remote" repos, but during Coding Basics we will only be using `push` to push code to GitHub.

 
In the above video we demonstrate `git push origin master`, but for Coding Basics `git push` will suffice. `origin` refers to the target Git remote, and `master` refers to the target branch. Rocket Academy has updated our repos to use `main` as the default branch name as per GitHub's latest convention, so if you wanted to specify the full command including remote and branch for Basics, you could use `git push origin main`.

### GitHub Pull Request

A GitHub "[**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" \(PR\) is a request to pull changes from 1 repo on GitHub to another. PRs are most commonly used as a code-review mechanism, where developers submit PRs for review before merging the code in those PRs to their company's shared repo. We will use PRs in Coding Basics to submit projects.

When we've pushed our changes to our repo, we'll click the "Pull requests" button to create a new pull request.

## Cheatsheet

Here is the workflow for Coding Basics projects:

1. Go to the project repo page. Click the "Fork" button to copy the repo to our own GitHub account.
2. In the command line on our local computer, **clone the repo from our own Github account's copy of the repo.**
3. Once the repo is on our computer, make the changes we want, and follow the Git workflow and cheatsheet [here](../2-organising-and-managing-code-files/2.2-git.md#cheat-sheet) to commit those changes.
4. `git push` our changes to our repo. Refresh the repo page to see our commits in the repo.
5. Create a pull request in GitHub. This connects our work on the repo _in our account_ to the original Rocket Academy repo. Fill in the survey and submit.

## Exercises

### Follow Along

Follow along with the video and create a fork and pull request of the [`github-practice` repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/github-practice). Note there is no survey to complete for the practice repo.
