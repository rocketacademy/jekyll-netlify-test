# 8.1: Program Lifecycle and State

## Introduction

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxxwcMJN8ec" caption="" %}

Our programs have so far handled ephemeral data that exists only while `main` or the relevant parent function is running. Now we will handle data that persists _across_ runs of `main`, and functions in our app in general.

### Global Variables

#### Summary

We will use our dice game to demonstrate the value of data persistence. In a dice game, we may want to keep track of the "bank roll" or score for the duration of our game. We need a syntax to store a value \(bank roll in this case\) that we read and update when `main` runs and is also available the _next time_ `main` runs.

The syntax we will use is called "**global variables**". Global variables in Coding Basics will persist from when the program loads in the browser to when we close the tab or reload the page. Try running the following code line by line in Chrome DevTools. The variable `number` persists across our commands, but when we refresh the page, `number` is no longer available. Similarly, our global variable data will persist across function calls, but not across browser sessions.

```javascript
var number = 5;
number = number * 2;
number;
```

#### Function Scope

As a recap of "local variables", recall the `main` function we've been using so far. In this function, `myOutputValue` only exists during the execution of `main`, corresponding to 1 Submit-button click.

```javascript
var main = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = convertKmToMiles(input);
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

If we try to inspect the value of `myOutputValue` in the console after clicking Submit, `myOutputValue` doesn't exist.

```javascript
myOutputValue;
```

This behaviour is common to all variables declared inside a function, and a demonstration of "function scope" in JavaScript. This means that variables declared in a function are available for the life of that function, then they disappear.

#### Global State

Global variables or "global state" is the idea that we can declare variables outside of functions, and have those variables' values persist across function calls. In this example, we persist `papayaCount`, in this case a count of the number of times a user has clicked Submit. `papayaCount` is part of `myOutputValue`, which shows the user how many times they have clicked Submit.

```javascript
var papayaCount = 0;
var main = function (input) {
  papayaCount = papayaCount + 1;
  var myOutputValue = 'You have ' + papayaCount + ' papayas';
  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### Global Variables for Dice Guessing

Bank roll or score is an application of the global "counter" variable to our dice game. In the following example, we increment `bankRoll` every time the player correctly guesses the dice roll.

```javascript
var bankRoll = 10;

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    bankRoll = bankRoll + 1;

    myOutputValue = 'you win. current bank roll: ' + bankRoll;
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

## Exercises \(Base\)

### Follow Along

Follow along with the videos and duplicate the code.

### **App Setup**

For the following exercises, start with the [Coding Basics Starter Code repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code) and replace the code in `script.js` with the following dice game code.

```javascript
var rollDice = function () {
  // produces a decimal between 0 and 6
  var randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  // take off the decimal
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(randomDecimal);

  // it's anumber from 0 - 5 ... add 1
  var diceNumber = randomInteger + 1;

  return diceNumber;
};

var main = function (input) {
  var randomDiceNumber = rollDice();

  var myOutputValue = 'you lose';

  if (randomDiceNumber == input) {
    myOutputValue = 'you win';
  }

  return myOutputValue;
};
```

### **Last Roll**

Create a version of the dice game that tells the user what their previous dice roll was.

#### Sample Output

```text
Your last roll was 4. You just rolled a 3. You guessed 3. You win!
```

### **Win / Loss**

As the user continues to play the game, tell them what their current win / loss percentage is.

#### Sample Output

```text
You win 23.5% of the time. You just rolled a 4. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

## Exercises \(More Comfortable\)

### **Most Rolled**

Keep track of the number that's rolled the most times.

#### Sample Output

```text
You just rolled a 4. 2 is the number you roll the most. You guessed 3. You lose!
```

### **Guessing**

If the player guess is off-by-1 they win 1 point. If the player guess is exact they win 2 points.

### **Advanced Guessing**

The player guess can be off by up to 4. If the player guess is off-by-4 they win 1 point. Off-by-3, 2 points, off-by-2, 3 points, off-by-1, 4 points, exact, 5 points.
